Heart Attack Prediction Algorithm Study
## Problem - 
A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked. The blockage is most often a buildup of fat, cholesterol, and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary
arteries). Data of the patient is always given to doctors through several reports. However, analysing every nook
and corner of these reports of multiple patients is a tired and slow process making the possibility of human error
become much higher.

## Objective - 
The probability of the heart attack occurring or not occurring can be predicted before-hand using A.I,
this in turn gives doctors indicators to take precaution or make the patience go through necessary treatments to
prevent it from happening. The A.I can effectively predict this for multiple patients without taking much time, with
only the expense of entering and feeding the program data.

## Solution - 
Our project uses the Cleveland dataset to learn, analyse and predict the probability of a heart attack
through various Models of machine learning. Different Models are compared with each other in order to find out
a Model which gives the best prediction accuracy for said dataset.
